# DAAProject
This project work was completed as part of my Data Analyst Associate Certification on DataCamp.

## Summary  
As part of this project, I conducted thorough data cleaning and analysis of compensation claims data for a fictional fast food chain's legal team. Utilising Excel, I efficiently transformed and processed the data, ensuring its completeness and validity. Through my analysis, I gained valuable insights into case closure time and successfully identified potential causes, accompanied by actionable solutions.

## Content
The dataset provided for this project was a singular csv file encompassing the entirety of food compensation claims closed by the Vivendo legal team across the 4 locations.
